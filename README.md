# Fingerprint-Recognition

---

This is a ***Digital Image Processing*** project

Fingerprint Recognition based on Python along with OpenCV

*proces.py* is the most hardcore and simple method and **NOT SO SATISFYING**,

*skele.py* is aiming at extracting the ridges but **ONLY A FEW** succeeded,

***manual.py*** is the latest version of fingerprint ridge extraction and the **TESTING** one.
